In this project I will be build the entire backend of an application; this will cover a number of core concepts I've covered thus far:

1) REST APIs
2) Routing
3) MVC Structure
4) ORMs through Active Record
5) CRUD Operations
6) Database design; specifically working with a many to many database encompassing three tables with one table serving as the JOIN table
7) Validations within a given table and Associations between tables in a DB
8)
